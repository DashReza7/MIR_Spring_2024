former world heavyweight champion rocky balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to adonis johnson  the son of his late friend and former rival apollo creed  adonis johnson is the son of the famous boxing champion apollo creed  who died in a boxing match in rocky iv  1985   adonis wasn t born until after his father s death and wants to follow his fathers footsteps in boxing  he seeks a mentor who is the former heavyweight boxing champion and former friend of apollo creed  the retired rocky balboa  rocky eventually agrees to mentor adonis  with rocky s help they hope to get a title job to face even deadlier opponents than his father  but whether he is a true fighter remains to be seen     blake ordonez adonis johnson lost his mother when he was young and would get into constant trouble and end up in foster care or juvenile detention  one day a woman goes to see him and tells him that her late husband is his father  and her husband s boxing great  apollo creed  she would take him in and educate him but he feels the need to be a boxer like his father  so he moves to philadelphia and approaches rocky balboa and asks rocky to train him  rocky tries to talk him out of it but it s something he needs to do  eventually rocky offers to train him and when he beats a great boxer and his connection to apollo is revealed  he is offered a chance to fight a world champion and all he needs to do is take the name  adonis johnson is the son of apollo creed  former heavyweight champion of the world and the man rocky balboa lost to in his first title fight  apollo creed died before johnson was born  so he never knew his father  johnson is also a fighter and is 15 0  though in unofficial fights in mexico  working in an office he decides to fight full time  he leaves los angeles and moves to philadelphia  hoping to get rocky balboa as his trainer  eventually they team up  and slowly johnson s career starts to take shape  meanwhile  the light heavyweight champion of the world  englishman ricky conlan  is looking for someone to fight    grantss even before he discovered he was the illegitimate son of former heavyweight champion apollo creed who died in the ring before he was born  los angeles residing adonis johnson   donny under more familiar circumstances   was always naturally using his fists to deal with life s issues  and even after apollo s widow  mary anne creed  took donny in to raise after he was shuttled from group home to group home following his own mother s passing  mary anne in the process giving him a privileged life to do with whatever his heart desires  donny still decides he wants to box as a career in honor of the father he never knew  up to him making this decision  donny had been self taught  fighting solely in what could only be considered street brawls in mexico despite they taking place in boxing rings  those that know of donny s heritage see him as untouchable to train due to the way his father died  as such  he decides to proceed without using the creed name so that he can make it on his own terms  with only those that need to know knowing  in also not using the creed name  he will not sully his father s legacy if he doesn t succeed  he moves to philadelphia in hopes of training under another former heavyweight champ  rocky balboa  who was his father s nemesis but who ended up being his friend in their ultimate respect for each other in the ring  rocky  who does learn who donny is as one of the people who needs to be in the know  initially declines donny s request as having put the life of boxing behind him  however  donny is able to wear rocky down for rocky eventually to agree to become his trainer  rocky coming out of boxing retirement raises some questions as to why and the eventual discovery of donny s creed heritage  while the creed balboa combination in name alone can open doors  both donny and rocky have to decide if using the creed name is the right move specifically for donny  especially with others who may have ulterior motives not in donny s best interest  regardless of what they decide to do  they will spiritually have others in their corner  mary anne  who despite not liking donny s career path  still wants to see her adoptive son thrive and succeed in whatever he does  donny s girlfriend  bianca  who is nonetheless facing her own issues as an aspiring singer who has progressive hearing loss  and apollo  who lives in both donny himself and rocky  through it all  other real life issues taking place outside the ring may factor into what happens to donny  huggo", "wolverine
